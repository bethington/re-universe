# Ghidra Analysis Preservation Strategy

## 🚨 **CRITICAL OVERSIGHT IDENTIFIED**

The current migration plan lacks a **comprehensive strategy for preserving existing Ghidra analysis work** from the 5,082 projects in the pd2 repository. This needs immediate attention before proceeding with migration.

## **Current Situation Analysis**

### **Existing Repository Status**
- **5,082 projects** in `repo-data/pd2/`
- **Unknown amount of analysis work** - Could represent months/years of research
- **Potential duplicate binaries** - Same files analyzed multiple times
- **Risk of losing valuable analysis** if not properly preserved

### **Critical Questions to Address**
1. **Which projects contain valuable analysis?** - Function names, comments, structs
2. **Which binaries have the best documentation?** - Most complete analysis work
3. **How do we merge analysis from duplicate binaries?** - Combine insights
4. **What's the overlap with our new binary collection?** - Version mapping

## **Proposed Preservation Methodology**

### **Phase 1: Analysis Audit (IMMEDIATE)**

#### **1.1 Project Inventory**
```bash
# Survey all 5,082 projects to identify:
- Binary types and versions
- Analysis completion levels
- Function naming quality
- Documentation depth
- Research notes and findings
```

#### **1.2 Priority Classification**
```
HIGH PRIORITY (Preserve Immediately):
- D2Server.dll analysis (if exists) - UNIQUE
- D2Game.dll variants with extensive function mapping
- D2Net.dll with protocol documentation
- Projects with significant custom structs/enums

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Merge Later):
- Standard DLL analysis with basic function names
- Version-specific analysis that maps to our collection
- Partially documented projects with research value

LOW PRIORITY (Archive Only):
- Empty or minimal analysis projects
- Duplicate projects with no additional insights
- Corrupted or incomplete project files
```

#### **1.3 Binary-to-Analysis Mapping**
```
Create matrix mapping:
our_binaries/1.00/D2game.dll → pd2_projects/[project_ids_with_analysis]
our_binaries/1.09d/D2Net.dll → pd2_projects/[relevant_analysis_projects]
```

### **Phase 2: Analysis Extraction & Merging**

#### **2.1 Best-Analysis Identification**
For each binary in our collection:
1. **Find all existing pd2 projects** analyzing the same binary
2. **Compare analysis quality** - function count, naming, comments
3. **Identify best analysis** - most complete documentation
4. **Extract valuable insights** from other versions

#### **2.2 Analysis Merging Strategy**
```
For duplicate binary analysis:
├── Primary Project: Keep most complete analysis as base
├── Secondary Projects: Extract unique insights
│   ├── Function names not in primary
│   ├── Comments and documentation
│   ├── Custom data types and structures
│   └── Research notes and findings
└── Consolidated Project: Merge all valuable analysis
```

#### **2.3 Metadata Preservation**
```
For each preserved project, document:
- Original project name/ID
- Analysis creation date
- Function count and completion level
- Unique insights contributed
- Source of analysis (original researcher notes)
```

### **Phase 3: Integration with New Structure**

#### **3.1 Hybrid Approach**
```
diablo2/vanilla/1.00/
├── D2Server.dll/                    # NEW: Clean import for fresh analysis
├── D2Server.dll.legacy/            # PRESERVED: Best existing analysis
├── D2game.dll/                     # MERGED: New binary + best existing analysis
└── analysis-sources/               # METADATA: Track analysis provenance
```

#### **3.2 Analysis Inheritance Strategy**
1. **Start with best existing analysis** (if available)
2. **Enhance with new research** on clean binary
3. **Cross-reference findings** between versions
4. **Maintain analysis lineage** - track contribution sources

## **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Before Proceeding with Migration:**

#### **Step 1: Emergency Audit (TODAY)**
```bash
# Access existing pd2 repository and catalog:
1. List all 5,082 project names/IDs
2. Identify projects analyzing D2Server.dll (CRITICAL)
3. Find projects with high function-name counts
4. Locate projects with extensive custom data types
```

#### **Step 2: Priority Preservation (THIS WEEK)**
```bash
# Extract highest-value analysis immediately:
1. Any D2Server.dll analysis - UNIQUE, irreplaceable
2. Comprehensive D2Game.dll analysis - Core engine insights
3. Network protocol documentation - D2Net.dll analysis
4. Version-specific insights - Unique to certain D2 versions
```

#### **Step 3: Migration Strategy Revision**
```
Update migration plan to:
├── Phase 1a: Analysis Audit & Preservation
├── Phase 1b: Repository Restructure
├── Phase 2: Binary Import with Analysis Integration
└── Phase 3: Enhanced Research Framework
```

## **Risk Assessment**

### **🚨 HIGH RISK - Immediate Action Required**
- **Data Loss**: Potential loss of months/years of analysis work
- **Unique Insights**: D2Server.dll analysis may exist and be irreplaceable
- **Research Continuity**: Breaking connection to previous findings

### **🎯 Mitigation Strategy**
1. **STOP current migration** until audit complete
2. **Emergency backup** of highest-value projects
3. **Develop preservation methodology** before restructuring
4. **Integrate rather than replace** existing analysis

## **Revised Migration Approach**

### **Option 1: Analysis-First Migration**
1. **Audit existing projects** for analysis value
2. **Extract and preserve** highest-quality analysis
3. **Merge with new binaries** - best of both approaches
4. **Continue with enhanced dataset**

### **Option 2: Parallel Development**
1. **Preserve existing pd2 repository** intact
2. **Create new diablo2 repository** alongside
3. **Gradually migrate analysis** as we identify value
4. **Eventually consolidate** when mapping complete

### **Option 3: Hybrid Integration**
1. **Rename pd2 → pd2_legacy** (preserve existing)
2. **Create structured diablo2** repository
3. **Link/import analysis** from legacy projects
4. **Best-of-both-worlds** approach

## **Recommendation: PAUSE & AUDIT**

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Halt current migration** until preservation strategy complete
2. **Emergency audit** of existing 5,082 projects
3. **Identify highest-value analysis** for immediate preservation
4. **Revise migration plan** to integrate rather than replace

**The existing analysis work could be invaluable** - we must preserve it before restructuring.
