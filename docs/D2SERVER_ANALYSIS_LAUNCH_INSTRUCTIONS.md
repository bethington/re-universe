# D2Server.dll Analysis - Launch Instructions

## 🎯 **READY TO BEGIN UNIQUE RESEARCH**

**Status**: All preparation complete - Ready for Ghidra project creation
**Binary**: D2Server.dll (84,480 bytes) - Only official server binary ever released
**Workspace**: Complete analysis environment prepared

---

## **🚀 IMMEDIATE LAUNCH STEPS**

### **Step 1: Launch Ghidra**
```bash
# Navigate to Ghidra installation
cd /home/ben/re-universe/ghidra/

# Launch Ghidra GUI
./ghidraRun
```

### **Step 2: Create New Project**
```
In Ghidra GUI:
1. File → New Project
2. Choose "Non-Shared Project"
3. Project Directory: /home/ben/re-universe/ghidra-projects/diablo2/
4. Project Name: D2Server_v1.00_Analysis
5. Click "Finish"
```

### **Step 3: Import D2Server.dll**
```
In Project Window:
1. File → Import File
2. Select: /home/ben/re-universe/ghidra-projects/diablo2/vanilla/1.00/D2Server.dll
3. Format: Portable Executable (PE) [should auto-detect]
4. Options: Accept defaults (x86:LE:32:default)
5. Click "OK" to import
```

### **Step 4: Open CodeBrowser and Analyze**
```
After Import:
1. Double-click "D2Server.dll" in project window
2. When prompted for analysis:
   - Select "Yes" to analyze now
   - Choose "Analyze All" with default options
   - Wait for auto-analysis to complete
```
